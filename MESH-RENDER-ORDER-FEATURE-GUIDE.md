# Mesh render order feature guide

Sets three.js `renderOrder` on individual **named** meshes inside a single
loaded model, so one asset's own overlapping/layered internal parts draw in
a controlled order relative to *each other* — a finer granularity than
[Render Order](RENDER-ORDER-FEATURE-GUIDE.md), which sets one uniform value
across a *whole* model for ordering it relative to *other* objects. Ported
from `Rosa_module`, where it was hardcoded to one specific asset's mesh
names (`Mesh_1`..`Mesh_8`); this version takes the name→order mapping as a
runtime attribute so it works on any glTF whose named sub-meshes need
relative ordering, without editing source code per project. See
[3. Under the hood](#3-under-the-hood) for why this had to become its own
feature rather than folding into `render-order`, and
[4. Incompatibilities](#4-incompatibilities-risks--troubleshooting) for a
real conflict with [LOD + Billboard](LOD-BILLBOARD-FEATURE-GUIDE.md) this
port found and documents rather than silently working around.

**Assets:** [`mesh-render-order-rosa.glb`](src/assets/mesh-render-order-rosa.glb) —
used only by the combined example above; not required to use this
component on your own assets. The scene it recreates is `Rosa_module`'s own
(matching the "Source" line above), but the `.glb` itself was pulled from a
different branch, plain `Rosa` — see [3](#3-under-the-hood) for why
`Rosa_module`'s own copy of this asset couldn't be used for a working
example.

**Read [RENDER-ORDER-AND-TRANSPARENCY-GUIDE.md](RENDER-ORDER-AND-TRANSPARENCY-GUIDE.md)
before using this on anything transparent** — same underlying render-queue
mental model as [Render Order](RENDER-ORDER-FEATURE-GUIDE.md) applies here
too, just at named-submesh granularity instead of whole-model granularity.

## 1. Step-by-step: adding this to a new project

1. **Copy the file** — `mesh-render-order.ts` — into your project's own
   `src/a-frame-components/`. No path changes, no data files.

2. **Register it** in your project's `src/manifest.ts`:

   ```ts
   import meshRenderOrder from "./a-frame-components/mesh-render-order";

   export const manifest: Manifest = {
     assets: assetManifest.assets,
     components: {
       // ...whatever you already have...
       "mesh-render-order": meshRenderOrder
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Find your mesh names** — open the glTF in a viewer/inspector (or your
   DCC tool's outliner) and note the exact mesh names as authored. These
   must match `node.name` after `GLTFLoader` parses the file — see
   [3](#3-under-the-hood) for a caveat about asset-compression tools
   stripping names.

4. **Wire it into the scene** — see
   [2. Entities & attributes](#2-entities--attributes) or copy directly
   from `examples/mesh-render-order-usage.html`.

5. **Build and test** — `npm run build`, then `npm run dev`. Like
   `render-order`, this is a visual effect only — you need overlapping
   transparent sub-meshes in view to see it doing anything.

## 2. Entities & attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mesh-render-order` | string | `""` | Semicolon-separated `MeshName: number` pairs, e.g. `mesh-render-order="Flame_A: 1; Flame_B: 2; Body: 3"`. Every named mesh found inside the loaded model gets `node.renderOrder` set to its listed value; unlisted meshes are left untouched. A-Frame's schema system doesn't support fully dynamic keys, so this is one string attribute parsed by hand, not a multi-property object schema like most other components here. |

```html
<a-entity gltf-model="#Rosa" mesh-render-order="orange flame: 1; violet flame: 2; person squat: 3"></a-entity>
```

A malformed entry (missing colon, non-numeric value) is skipped with a
console warning rather than discarding the whole mapping — one typo won't
blank out every other entry.

Nothing to call — it applies automatically once the mesh loads, and again
any time the `mesh-render-order` attribute itself changes at runtime (e.g.
`el.setAttribute('mesh-render-order', '...')`).

## 3. Under the hood

Listens for `object3dset` (filtered to `detail.type === "mesh"`) — A-Frame's
generic "a mesh object3D was just set" event — plus an immediate check in
case the mesh is already present. Once the mesh exists, traverses its
object3D graph and, for every mesh node whose `name` is a key in the parsed
mapping, sets `node.renderOrder` to the matching value. Also re-applies on
`update()` (skipping the initial call, which `init()` already handles), so
changing the attribute string after the model has loaded takes effect
immediately without needing a reload.

### Why this couldn't just be an option on `render-order`

`render-order` ([its own guide](RENDER-ORDER-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)) sets *one*
number on *every* mesh in a loaded model — the right tool when a whole
object needs ordering relative to *other* objects in the scene. This
feature instead needs *several* numbers, one per named sub-mesh, for
ordering a *single* asset's own parts relative to each other. Those are
different shapes of data (one number vs. a name→number map) driving
different intents (inter-object vs. intra-object ordering) — cramming both
into one component's schema would make the common case (`render-order="2"`)
harder to read for no real benefit, and the two are safe to use
*together* on different entities (an object using `mesh-render-order`
internally can still carry a plain `render-order` on an ancestor, or vice
versa on a sibling) — see [4](#4-incompatibilities-risks--troubleshooting)
for the one case where combining them on the *same* entity's meshes causes
a real conflict.

### What changed from the source

The source (`Rosa_module`) hardcoded both the mesh names and their order
directly in TypeScript:

```ts
const RENDER_ORDER: Record<string, number> = {
  Mesh_1: 1, Mesh_2: 2, /* ...through Mesh_8 */
};
```

— meaning every new project wanting this behavior on a *different* asset
would need to hand-edit the component's source rather than just author an
attribute. This port replaces the hardcoded map with the `mesh-render-order`
string attribute, parsed the same way the rest of this project's
multi-value attributes are (e.g. compare to how `random-field` or
`proximity-wave`'s schemas are authored) — semicolon-separated `key: value`
pairs, parsed once in `init()`/`update()` rather than on every apply.

**Verified, not assumed, against two versions of the source asset:** both
`Rosa_module`'s copy and the plain `Rosa` branch's own copy of this
character model were inspected directly (their embedded glTF JSON extracted
from the binary container) rather than trusting the hardcoded names at face
value.

- `Rosa_module`'s copy (152 KB, almost certainly run through a compressor
  like `gltfpack`) has every mesh-bearing node's `name` stripped entirely.
- The plain `Rosa` branch's own copy (435 KB, uncompressed — now also
  bundled here as `mesh-render-order-rosa.glb`, see the Files list above)
  still has its original names: `"orange flame"`, `"violet flame"`,
  `"green flame"`, `"lime flame"`, `"person squat"`, `"person stand"`,
  `"person nails"` — seven meshes, not eight.

Neither version has any node named `"Mesh_1"` through `"Mesh_8"`. Since
even the never-recompressed original doesn't have those names, the source's
hardcoded `RENDER_ORDER` map was very plausibly never valid against this
asset at any point in its life — a leftover from an even earlier draft of
the model, not something a later compression step broke. This is a
pre-existing data/source-code mismatch on the original branch, not a bug in
either the source or the ported component — but it means whoever adopts
this on a *new* asset should verify their own glTF's actual node names
first (open it in a viewer, or log `mesh.name` for each traversed node
during development) rather than assuming a name scheme.
`examples/mesh-render-order-unlit-material-rosa-scene.html` demonstrates
this component against the asset's real names, working end-to-end.

## 4. Incompatibilities, risks & troubleshooting

### Can't fix everything — see the cross-feature guide

Same render-queue fundamentals as `render-order`: only sorts within the
opaque or transparent render queue (never across them), sorts whole mesh
nodes not individual triangles, and falls back to camera-distance sorting
for two nodes with equal values. See
[RENDER-ORDER-AND-TRANSPARENCY-GUIDE.md §4.1](RENDER-ORDER-AND-TRANSPARENCY-GUIDE.md#41-renderorder-cannot-fix-everything).

### Real conflict with LOD + Billboard — checked, and it does conflict

Unlike plain `render-order` (which composes cleanly with
[`lod-object`](LOD-BILLBOARD-FEATURE-GUIDE.md) — see that component's own
guide §3), **`mesh-render-order` genuinely conflicts** with `lod-object`
when placed on the same `.lod-mesh` child, or on any entity whose mesh
`lod-manager` also drives:

- `lod-object.ts` records exactly *one* `localOrder` value per `.lod-mesh`
  DOM child element (read from that child's own `render-order` attribute),
  and pushes `{ node, localOrder }` for **every** mesh node found while
  traversing that one child — all sharing that single value.
- `lod-manager.updateRenderOrder()` runs every frame and unconditionally
  overwrites `node.renderOrder = base + localOrder` for every recorded
  node, where `base` is the instance's camera-distance-ranked band offset.

Any per-named-mesh distinction `mesh-render-order` set inside that child's
loaded model is a plain, uniform `node.renderOrder` write — `lod-manager`
has no awareness of it and will silently stomp it every single frame the
instance is active, collapsing every named sub-mesh back to one shared
value. This is a real, confirmed conflict (not a "not tested yet" caveat
like [§4.5 below](RENDER-ORDER-AND-TRANSPARENCY-GUIDE.md#45-unlit-material-replaces-materials--a-different-risk-than-onbeforecompile-collisions)),
found by tracing exactly how `lod-manager` assigns render order rather than
assumed.

**Don't put `mesh-render-order` on a `.lod-mesh`/`.lod-billboard` child, or
on any entity nested under an active `lod-object`.** If an asset needs both
internal named-submesh ordering *and* LOD/billboard crossfading, apply
`mesh-render-order` to a version of the asset used *outside* any
`lod-object` group, or accept that the LOD system's own per-instance
banding is the only ordering that survives while that instance is under
LOD management.

### No interaction found with any other feature on this branch

Doesn't touch `document` listeners, shared/global state, or camera — only
ever writes `renderOrder` on named mesh nodes inside its own entity's
loaded model. Free to combine with `random-field`, `proximity-wave`,
`follow-node`, `wander-in-band`, `ar-button`/`sound-button`,
`mirror-shard`/`liquid-texture`, and a standalone (non-LOD)
`render-order`/`unlit-material` with no interaction at all.
