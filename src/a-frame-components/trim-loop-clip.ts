// Trim a glTF animation's dead lead-in/tail and play it on a loop.
//
// Blender's glTF exporter bakes keyframe *times* from the scene timeline: if you
// export only a preview range that starts at, say, frame 100, the first keyframe
// lands at ~100/fps seconds, not at 0. A plain `animation-mixer` then plays from
// t=0 and just holds that first frame for those seconds — the "big pause before
// the animation starts". There's no trim knob on `animation-mixer` for this.
//
// This component takes the loaded clips and shifts every track so the earliest
// keyframe sits at t=0, then clamps the clip duration to the span that actually
// contains keyframes. What's left is only the moving part, which it plays with a
// LoopPingPong (back-and-forth) loop. Use it INSTEAD of `animation-mixer` on the
// same entity as `gltf-model`:
//
//   <a-entity gltf-model="#MainCharacter" trim-loop-clip="timeScale: 0.4"></a-entity>
//   <a-entity gltf-model="#Seeds" trim-loop-clip="loop: repeat"></a-entity>
//
// When a model has multiple clips (e.g. a rig animation plus a separately
// keyed submesh), each clip's own trimmed duration is rarely identical —
// looping them independently via the mixer's normal per-action bookkeeping,
// each bounces/wraps at its own length and drifts out of phase a little more
// every cycle, even though they start in sync. (three.js's built-in
// `AnimationAction.syncWith()` looks like the fix for exactly this, but in
// practice its synced relationship resets at every loop boundary when the
// clip lengths differ, producing a step-drift once per master cycle instead
// of none.) So with more than one clip, this component takes over time
// advancement itself: every action is driven directly off ONE shared clock —
// the *longest* clip's duration sets the loop period, and every action's
// `.time` is that same raw elapsed value, clamped to its own (possibly
// shorter) duration. This plays each clip at its natural authored rate
// rather than stretching it to fit the master's length — stretching a
// slightly-shorter clip to always finish exactly when the master does makes
// it play a little slower than 1:1, which reads as "lagging behind" for the
// whole cycle. A clip that finishes early just holds its final pose until
// the shared clock (and the master with it) also completes and reflects.
