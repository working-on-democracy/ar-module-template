# Image tracking feature guide

Anchors content to a specific real-world printed/displayed image — detects
a target image in the live camera feed and shows/hides/positions content
to track it, entirely via 8th Wall's own image-target engine. This was
`main`'s own baseline demo content (not ported from a `_module` branch —
see [3. Under the hood](#3-under-the-hood)), previously wired directly into
`ArModule.vue`; moved here to keep the baseline scene free of example
content, matching how every other feature in this template works.

Unlike every other guide in this catalog, this feature has **no
`src/a-frame-components/*.ts` file to copy** — the two components involved
(`xrextras-named-image-target`, `xrextras-play-video`) are provided by the
8th Wall `xrextras` library itself, already loaded in every preview flavour
and by the real host. What's project-specific is the target image data and
the content you anchor to it — see [1](#1-step-by-step-adding-this-to-a-new-project).

Files:

```
src/image-targets/video-target.json          # example target descriptor
src/image-targets/video-target_original.jpg   # \
src/image-targets/video-target_cropped.jpg     #  the 4 images the descriptor
src/image-targets/video-target_thumbnail.jpg   #  references, all from the
src/image-targets/video-target_luminance.jpg  # /  same compiler-tool export
examples/image-tracking-usage.html   # scene wiring + full attribute reference
```

**Assets:** [`jellyfish-video.mp4`](../src/assets/jellyfish-video.mp4) — the
example's video content, played once the target is detected.

**Not active by default** — `src/manifest.ts` doesn't currently register
any `imageTargets`. This template still ships the example target's files
(so there's a ready-to-test target and a worked example to copy from), but
adding it back to `manifest.ts` is an explicit step — see [1](#1-step-by-step-adding-this-to-a-new-project).

## 1. Step-by-step: adding this to a new project

1. **Get a target image descriptor.** This template already ships one
   (`src/image-targets/video-target.*`) — usable as-is for testing, or as a
   reference for the file shapes below. For your **own** target image,
   run it through 8th Wall's image-target compiler tool (part of the 8th
   Wall workspace/console — this project doesn't bundle that tool, only its
   output format) and download the resulting bundle: one `<name>.json`
   descriptor plus 4 images (`_original`, `_cropped`, `_thumbnail`,
   `_luminance`). Drop all 5 files into `src/image-targets/` — this folder
   is scanned and copied into every build automatically (see
   [3](#3-under-the-hood)), no manifest entry needed for the files
   themselves.

2. **Register the target's JSON** in your project's `src/manifest.ts`:

   ```ts
   import videoTarget from "./image-targets/video-target.json";
   // (name it after your own target file instead)

   export const manifest: Manifest = {
     assets: assetManifest.assets,
     components: { /* ...whatever you already have... */ },
     imageTargets: [videoTarget]
     // multiple targets: imageTargets: [videoTarget, anotherTarget]
   };
   ```

3. **Drop in whatever content should be anchored to the target** — e.g. the
   video asset this example uses (`src/assets/jellyfish-video.mp4`, or your
   own `.mp4`/`.glb`/image) — into `src/assets/` as usual.

4. **Wire it into the scene** — see
   [2. Entities & attributes](#2-entities--attributes) or copy directly
   from `examples/image-tracking-usage.html`.

5. **Build and test with `npm run dev:ar`, not `npm run dev`.** This is
   not optional — see [3](#3-under-the-hood) for why the plain VR/desktop
   preview can never show this working, no matter how correctly it's
   wired. Point your phone's camera at the target image (or its
   `_original`/`_cropped` file, displayed on another screen) to test
   detection.

   **Display the target large and against a plain background.** A
   repeating/patterned background near the target (e.g. patterned
   wallpaper) is a real, observed false-positive risk — the tracker can
   lock onto a stretch of the pattern instead of the actual target,
   showing content in the wrong place with no error. Fill a large
   fraction of the camera frame with the target image itself.

6. **Lay out your content using the footprint convention** — see
   [1a](#1a-the-footprint-convention-the-image-is-the-floor) before
   placing anything. Getting this wrong (an arbitrary fixed offset like
   `position="0 -2 0"`) is the most common way for content to track
   correctly (confirmed by events firing, wrapper visible) while still
   being invisible — placed meters away from where the camera happens to
   be looking.

### 1a. The footprint convention: the image is the floor

Every scene anchored to an image target should treat the tracked image
as the scene's ground plane, not as a poster something else stands in
front of: `xrextras-named-image-target`'s local X/Y axes match the
printed image's own width/depth exactly (its origin is the image's
*centre*, not a corner — confirmed via `xrextrasimagegeometry`'s
`scaledWidth`/`scaledHeight`, which describe the full span centred on
0,0); local Z is height above the image, pointing out of it toward the
camera. Two hard rules follow:

- **Horizontal (X/Y) position must stay within the image's own printed
  bounds.** Only Z (height) is free to extend beyond them.
- **Sizes and offsets should be proportional to the footprint**, not
  fixed units — so a scene keeps its proportions when a placeholder
  target is swapped for the real, differently-sized one.

In code (from `sound-player`'s `ArModule.vue`, the first scene built and
verified against this convention):

```ts
// FOOTPRINT_DEPTH is always 1 — the engine normalizes the target's local Y
// extent to 1. FOOTPRINT_WIDTH follows the target's own aspect ratio.
const targetProps = (manifest.imageTargets?.[0] as any)?.properties;
const FOOTPRINT_DEPTH = 1;
const FOOTPRINT_WIDTH = targetProps ? targetProps.width / targetProps.height : 0.75;

const SPHERE_RADIUS = FOOTPRINT_DEPTH * 0.08;
const CONTENT_HEIGHT = FOOTPRINT_DEPTH * 0.2; // how high above the image content floats
```

```html
<xrextras-named-image-target name="video-target">
  <a-entity> <!-- no position — sits exactly at the target's own anchor -->
    <!-- content positioned as fractions of FOOTPRINT_WIDTH/FOOTPRINT_DEPTH,
         height (Z) proportional to FOOTPRINT_DEPTH, never Y/X beyond ±half
         the footprint -->

    <!-- Ground plane = the image itself: no rotation (a-plane's default
         orientation already matches the image's own plane), sized to the
         image's own bounds, sitting at Z=0. Semi-transparent so the
         footprint is visible for orientation while building/debugging. -->
    <a-plane :width="FOOTPRINT_WIDTH" :height="FOOTPRINT_DEPTH"
        material="color: #3b82f6; opacity: 0.35; side: double" shadow></a-plane>
  </a-entity>
</xrextras-named-image-target>
```

Rotating content in a circle *above* the image (a "wandering" object, a
spinner, etc.) should rotate around **Z**, not Y — Z is this convention's
up-axis, so `animation="property: rotation; to: 0 0 360; ..."` orbits
horizontally above the image; `to: 0 360 0` (the Y-up default one would
normally reach for) tips the orbit into the image instead.

## 2. Entities & attributes

Best-effort — from this project's own usage plus reading the vendored
source (`node_modules/@8thwall/xrextras/dist/xrextras.js`), not authoritative
upstream documentation, since this is vendored code this project doesn't
own (see [3](#3-under-the-hood)).

### `xrextras-named-image-target`

| Attribute | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Must exactly match the `name` field inside your target's own JSON file. This is how the engine knows which detected target this wrapper cares about — a scene can have several `xrextras-named-image-target` blocks, one per registered target, each keyed by its own name. |

Its children are shown/hidden and positioned to track the detected target
automatically — you don't drive their position yourself.

### `xrextras-play-video`

| Attribute | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `video` | selector | The `<video>` asset to play — reference a manifest asset by id, same as `gltf-model`. |
| `thumb` | selector | Poster-frame image shown before playback starts. |
| `canstop` | boolean (presence) | If present, tapping the video while it's already playing stops it (not just pauses) — a second tap restarts from the beginning. |

```html
<xrextras-named-image-target name="video-target">
  <a-entity
      xrextras-play-video="video: #jellyfish-video; thumb: #video-target; canstop: true"
      geometry="primitive: plane; height: 1; width: 0.79;">
  </a-entity>
</xrextras-named-image-target>
```

`#video-target` as the `thumb` selector works because every manifest asset
*and* every image-target's own image files are auto-injected with the same
filename-without-extension-is-the-id convention — `video-target_thumbnail.jpg`
becomes id `video-target` alongside the target's other files.

## 3. Under the hood

### The compiled target descriptor

`video-target.json` is 8th Wall's own image-target compiler tool output —
not something authored by hand. Its shape (`imagePath`, `resources.{originalImage,
croppedImage, thumbnailImage, luminanceImage}`, `name`, `type: "PLANAR"`,
`properties.{top, left, width, height, isRotated, originalWidth,
originalHeight}`, `created`/`updated`) was cross-checked against 8th Wall's
own official `studio-image-targets-example` reference project (a different
target image, same tool) and matches field-for-field. That reference
project's own exports also include two fields ours doesn't —
`geometryImage` and `loadAutomatically` — both apparently optional/newer;
their absence here doesn't stop this target from loading or working. If a
future export from the tool includes them, there's nothing to change on
this project's side — they just ride along as extra JSON fields.

### `src/image-targets/` — separate from `src/assets/`, same shape of plumbing

Distinct from `src/assets/` (used for manifest `assets`), but handled by
near-identical Vite plugin logic: scanned non-recursively, served at
`/image-targets/*` in dev, copied into `dist-platform/image-targets/` on
build. Registering a target's `.json` in `manifest.ts`'s `imageTargets`
array is what actually activates it — the image *files* ship in every
build either way (same as any unregistered example asset in `src/assets/`),
but nothing configures XR8 to look for a target unless its JSON is in that
array.

### How a target actually reaches the camera engine — and why `npm run dev` can't test this

`manifest.imageTargets` is fed to `XR8.XrController.configure({
imageTargetData })` (`lib/host-runtime.ts`'s `configureImageTargets`) —
which is a **no-op without XR8 present** (`if (!xr?.XrController?.configure
...) return`). The plain VR/desktop preview (`npm run dev`, `lib/preview.ts`)
never loads XR8 or calls this at all — there's no live camera feed for it
to detect anything in regardless. Only the real AR preview (`npm run dev:ar`,
`lib/preview-ar.ts`) and the real production host actually run XR8's image
detection. This means correctly-wired image-tracking content will show
literally nothing in `npm run dev` — not a bug, just the wrong preview for
this feature. Always verify on `npm run dev:ar` (or a real device build).

One extra wrinkle specific to the AR preview harness, not something a
project needs to replicate: `lib/preview-ar.ts` configures image targets
*twice* — once immediately once XR8 boots (`XR8.XrController.configure({
imageTargetData: manifest.imageTargets })`, **before** `<a-scene xrweb>`
starts its session), and again inside `mount()` via the same
`configureImageTargets` the real host's flow uses. The first call exists
only because XR8 rejects image targets passed after a session has already
started ("Image Targets are not supported in the current session") — image
targets are a session capability that must be present in the *first*
`configure()` call. The real host's own bootstrapping presumably already
handles this itself; it isn't part of what this guide's step-by-step asks
you to set up.

### Required runtime setup — get this wrong and it fails silently or crashes

Three things outside `manifest.ts`/the scene markup have to be correct
for any of the above to actually run, all found the hard way (2026-08-30,
`sound-player` branch — first real on-device end-to-end verification of
this feature, see below):

1. **The 8Frame build must be the one that pairs with
   `@8thwall/engine-binary`, not the one on `cdn.8thwall.com`.** They can
   share a filename (`8frame-1.5.0.min.js`) while being completely
   different, incompatible binaries (375KB CDN vs. 1.4MB vendored —
   confirmed by diffing them byte-for-byte). The mismatched pair throws
   `Error: No valid session manager to handle this session` as soon as
   the AR session tries to start, with camera permission never even
   requested. There's no npm package for the correct build — it ships
   only in the `external/scripts/` folder of 8th Wall's own example
   projects (e.g. `github.com/8thwall/aframe-world-effects-example`,
   `aframe-image-targets-example`, distributed via git LFS). This
   template vendors it at `lib/vendor/8frame-1.5.0.min.js` and copies it
   into `external/scripts/` at build time (see `vite.config.ts`,
   `ar.html`) instead of pinning it via `package.json`.

2. **`xrweb` needs `allowedDevices: any` and must not set
   `disableWorldTracking: true`** (omitting it entirely, as this
   template's `lib/preview-ar.ts` now does, is the correct default —
   `disableWorldTracking: true` is what 8th Wall's own
   `aframe-image-targets-example` uses, but it disables the very SLAM
   pipeline module image tracking depends on when combined with this
   engine binary; confirmed by testing both). Get this wrong and the
   symptom is silent, not an error: `XR8.XrController.configure()`
   accepts the image target data without complaint, the camera feed
   shows up fine (a plain `getusermedia` fallback session starts
   successfully), but the "reality" pipeline module that would actually
   load the target image and fire `xrimagescanning`/`xrimagefound` never
   starts — nothing ever loads, nothing ever tracks, and there is no
   error anywhere to point at why.

3. **Don't wrap image-target-anchored content in a manual placement
   offset.** `lib/preview-ar.ts`'s `module-root` wrapper exists to
   preview a module "where it would appear in the app" for ordinary,
   non-tracked content — for image-target content, whose position is
   entirely driven by the tracked image's live pose, that additional
   offset just shifts the rendered content away from the actual image
   instead of leaving it anchored to it (this template's preview now
   skips the offset whenever `manifest.imageTargets?.length`). 8th
   Wall's own reference examples never nest `xrextras-named-image-target`
   under anything but `<a-scene>` directly — see
   [1a](#1a-the-footprint-convention-the-image-is-the-floor) for how
   content should be positioned instead.

### Verified end-to-end on a real device (2026-08-30, `sound-player` branch)

Point-camera-at-target → content tracks and is tappable, confirmed on
iPad. This was **not** working before the three fixes above — the
original "pre-existing, working baseline feature" assumption in this
guide's prior revision was wrong; it had never actually been tested
end-to-end on-device against the current `@8thwall/engine-binary`
dependency, and the runtime-setup issues above meant it silently
couldn't have worked. Re-verify after any 8Frame/engine-binary/xrweb
config change.

## 4. Incompatibilities, risks & troubleshooting

### Uses the host's shared cursor/raycaster `click`, not this template's own tap systems

`xrextras-play-video` (confirmed by reading the vendored source) tags
itself `class="cantap"` and listens for a plain `click` — i.e. it relies on
**A-Frame's own cursor/raycaster system**, configured by the host on the
shared `<a-camera>` to hit `.cantap` elements, not on
[`ar-button`](SOUND-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)/[`sound-button`](SOUND-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)'s
own `pointerdown`/`pointerup` handling or
[`mirror-shard`](MIRROR-SHARD-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)'s (which uses the same
`.cantap`/`click` mechanism, for the same reason).

### Real, previously-identified iOS click-suppression risk

iOS Safari has been observed to suppress the synthetic `click` A-Frame's
cursor system produces, once anything upstream in the same touch sequence
(e.g. `xrextras-gesture-detector`, used elsewhere for pinch/rotate) already
called `preventDefault()` — the exact reason
[Sound](SOUND-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)'s own tap system deliberately avoids
`click` in favour of raw `pointerdown`/`pointerup`. This hasn't been
independently re-verified against the pinned `xrextras` version (it's
vendored code this project doesn't own) — if a project combines a tappable
`xrextras-play-video` with pinch/rotate gestures, test tapping the video
specifically on iPad/iPhone before shipping.

### Potential double-fire with Sound if trigger zones visually overlap

No direct code conflict — `xrextras-play-video`'s `click`-based tap and
[Sound](SOUND-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)'s `pointerdown`/`pointerup`-based tap are
independent and don't call `preventDefault()`/`stopPropagation()` on each
other. But they observe the same physical touches: if a sound button's
trigger zone visually overlaps a tappable image-target video in screen
space, one tap could satisfy both systems and fire **both** — play a sound
*and* toggle the video — in the same gesture. Keep interactive zones
visually separated, or gate one (`enabled: false` on an `ar-button`) while
the other is relevant.

### No interaction found with `proximity-fade`/`proximity-fade-dither`/`proximity-cutout`

All three only patch materials reached via a bubbled `model-loaded` event
from a `gltf-model` descendant. The image-target's video plane is a plain
`<a-entity geometry="primitive: plane">` with a video texture — never a
`gltf-model` — so it never fires `model-loaded` and is never touched by any
of the three regardless of scene nesting.

### No interaction found with any other feature on this branch

No shared `document` listeners with anything except the click-suppression
risk above (which is about the *host's* shared cursor system, not a
listener this project's own code owns), no `renderOrder`, no
`onBeforeCompile` use. Free to combine with `random-field`, `lod-object`/
`lod-manager`, `render-order`, `wander-in-band`/`proximity-wave`, and
`mirror-shard`/`liquid-texture` with no interaction beyond the shared-tap
risks already noted above.

### Debugging playbook, in the order that actually narrows things down

Built up bisecting the "camera works but nothing tracks" failure this
guide's runtime-setup section above now covers. Each step rules out one
layer; don't skip ahead — a green light at step *N* doesn't mean steps
below it are fine.

1. **`XR8.XrController.configure.bind(...)` doesn't throw** → the engine
   (and its "slam" chunk specifically) loaded. If this throws, it's the
   8Frame/engine-binary pairing (point 1 above).
2. **A camera feed shows up, no console exception** → *some* session
   started, but tells you nothing about which one — a plain
   `getusermedia` fallback with zero tracking capability looks identical
   from the camera view alone.
3. **Wrap `XR8.addCameraPipelineModule`** and confirm a module named
   `"reality"` gets added, then wrap *its* `onStart` — if `onStart` never
   fires, the SLAM pipeline never actually started (point 2 above,
   `allowedDevices`/`disableWorldTracking`) even though nothing threw.
4. **Don't listen for `xrimagefound`/`xrimagescanning`/etc. on `window`.**
   The A-Frame integration dispatches these as events on the **`<a-scene>`
   element** (`sceneEl.emit(...)`), not on `window` — despite most 8th
   Wall vanilla-JS docs/examples showing `window.addEventListener(...)`.
   `window.addEventListener` listeners here will silently never fire even
   when tracking is working perfectly. Patch
   `EventTarget.prototype.dispatchEvent` directly (catches every target)
   if unsure where an event lands.
5. **`xrimagescanning` firing (with your target's name in `imageTargets`)
   confirms detection is actively running.** `xrimageupdated` firing
   continuously afterward confirms the target is currently found and
   tracked — position/rotation/scale updating each frame. If you get this
   far, tracking itself is not the problem; anything still wrong is
   rendering/positioning (steps 6–7).
6. **A test box with zero position offset, direct child of
   `xrextras-named-image-target`** (`<a-box color="red" scale="0.3 0.3 0.3"
   position="0 0 0.1"></a-box>`) renders exactly on the target → rendering
   and anchoring both work; any other content not appearing is a
   positioning bug in *that* content, not the tracking pipeline. This is
   the fastest way to separate "tracking is broken" from "tracking works,
   my layout is wrong" — don't debug the pipeline further once this
   renders correctly.
7. **Still nothing where you expect it, but the test box in step 6 works?**
   Check the [footprint convention](#1a-the-footprint-convention-the-image-is-the-floor)
   and the `module-root` offset (point 3 above) — by far the most common
   cause once the pipeline itself is confirmed working.

Two dead ends, noted so nobody re-walks them: the eruda mobile-console
Network tab reliably misses files loaded via dynamic `import()` (the
engine's own chunk-loading mechanism) — its absence there is not evidence
a chunk failed to load, only that this particular panel can't see how it
loaded. And a single-point-in-time visibility check
(`entity.object3D.visible`) can catch the target mid-lost/re-found cycle
and read `false` even though tracking is working fine seconds later —
poll over a few seconds, don't trust one snapshot.
