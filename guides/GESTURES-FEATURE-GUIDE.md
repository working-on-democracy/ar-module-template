# Gestures feature guide

Touch gestures for a model: hold and drag it along the ground, rotate it,
pinch to scale — configured in one attribute. Applicable to any entity.
Generalised from the Augmented Bahnhofsviertel ports
(`augmented-bahnhofsviertel`: `hold-drag`, plus the xrextras rotate/pinch
gestures the works #1–3, #8–10, #14, #21 use) — see
[3. Under the hood](#3-under-the-hood).

Files:

```
src/a-frame-components/gesture-control.ts
src/a-frame-components/hold-drag.ts
examples/gestures-usage.html   # scene wiring + attribute reference
```

No assets. Rotate and pinch come from xrextras, which the host and both
previews load — nothing to copy for them.

## 1. Step-by-step: adding this to a new project

1. **Copy the files** — `gesture-control.ts` and `hold-drag.ts` — into
   `src/a-frame-components/`.

2. **Register** in `src/manifest.ts`:

   ```ts
   import holdDrag from "./a-frame-components/hold-drag";
   import gestureControl from "./a-frame-components/gesture-control";

   components: {
     // ...whatever you already have...
     "hold-drag": holdDrag,
     "gesture-control": gestureControl
   }
   ```

3. **Wire the scene** — `gesture-control` on the model
   (`examples/gestures-usage.html`). Requirements are met by the host and
   `lib/preview-ar.ts` already: `xrextras-gesture-detector` on `<a-scene>`,
   and the camera's cursor/raycaster hitting `.cantap`.

4. **Build and test** — `npm run dev:ar` on a phone (`npm run dev` has no
   touch gestures): hold the model ~0.3 s, then drag; two fingers rotate
   and pinch.

## 2. Entities & attributes

### `gesture-control`

| Attribute | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `drag` | boolean | `true` | Hold, then drag along the ground (sets `hold-drag`). |
| `rotate` | string | `two-finger` | `none`, `one-finger` or `two-finger` (sets `xrextras-*-finger-rotate`). |
| `scale` | boolean | `true` | Pinch to scale (sets `xrextras-pinch-scale`). |
| `ground` | string | `""` | Selector of the ground entity for dragging. Empty = the parent's y = 0 plane. |
| `riseHeight` | number | `1` | Height while dragged, parent units. |
| `dragDelay` | number | `300` | ms to hold before the drag starts. |
| `rotateFactor` | number | `5` | Rotation per finger travel. |
| `minScale` / `maxScale` | number | `0.33` / `3` | Pinch limits, relative to the scale the entity had when `gesture-control` was set. |

### `hold-drag` (also usable on its own)

| Attribute | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ground` | selector | — | Ground entity; empty = the parent's y = 0 plane. |
| `groundId` | string | `""` | `xrextras-hold-drag` compatibility: ground by id (used when `ground` isn't set). |
| `cameraId` | string | `""` | `xrextras-hold-drag` compatibility: ignored — the scene's active camera is used. |
| `dragDelay` | number | `300` | ms to hold before dragging. |
| `riseHeight` | number | `1` | Height while dragged, parent units. |

Neither emits events.

```html
<a-entity place-in-front="distance: 2">
  <a-entity gltf-model="#Sculpture" gesture-control="rotate: one-finger; maxScale: 2"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

## 3. Under the hood

**Thin layer, not a re-implementation.** `gesture-control` only sets
(and, on change or removal, removes) `hold-drag`,
`xrextras-one/two-finger-rotate` and `xrextras-pinch-scale` on its own
entity, so the three gestures, their defaults and their pitfalls are
configured in one place. Pinch is only re-created when its own settings
change: `xrextras-pinch-scale` takes the entity's scale once, at init, as
its base — re-creating it on every update would make the already-pinched
size the new base.

**Why our own `hold-drag`.** `xrextras-hold-drag` writes the ground hit
point (world space) and a world-space `riseHeight` straight into the
entity's **local** position, and measures the drag distance between that
local position and the camera — verified in `@8thwall/xrextras`' source.
That is only right for an entity whose parent sits untransformed at the
scene origin; a module always sits under the host's offset root, so the
model jumps. `hold-drag` converts every point into the parent's space. The
press arrives as `mousedown` from the host's cursor (hence the `.cantap`
class it adds); finger movement and release come from
`xrextras-gesture-detector`'s `onefingermove`/`onefingerend` on the scene.
Without a ground entity it intersects the parent's y = 0 plane. The
original schema (`groundId`, `cameraId`) is still accepted, so markup
written for `xrextras-hold-drag` carries over.

## 4. Incompatibilities, risks & troubleshooting

- **Two-finger gestures are scene-wide.** `xrextras-two-finger-rotate` and
  `xrextras-pinch-scale` listen to `twofingermove` on the whole scene (not
  on the touched entity) — every entity with them turns/scales together.
  Use one `gesture-control` per scene, or on one group.
- **Pinch on the model, not a far-away group.** Pinch scales around the
  entity's own origin. On a group whose origin lies far from the model,
  the model drifts away while scaling and the size barely follows the
  fingers (found on an Augmented Bahnhofsviertel work).
- **Transform writers.** All three gestures write the entity's
  position/rotation/scale. Don't combine with `place-in-front`,
  `attach-to`, `wander-in-band` or `proximity-wave` on the same entity —
  put `gesture-control` on a child of a placed group.
- **iOS click suppression.** `xrextras-gesture-detector` calls
  `preventDefault()` on touches, after which iOS Safari drops the synthetic
  `click`. Tap features that rely on the host's cursor `click`
  (`xrextras-play-video`, [Mirror Shard](MIRROR-SHARD-FEATURE-GUIDE.md))
  are affected by the detector being on the scene in general, not by this
  feature specifically; [Sound](SOUND-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)'s `ar-button` and
  [Placement](PLACEMENT-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)'s tap detection use pointer
  events and are not.
- **One finger, two meanings.** With `rotate: one-finger`, a quick swipe
  rotates and hold-then-move drags. If that's confusing for a scene, use
  `two-finger` (default) or `drag: false`.
- **Draw/other host modes.** The host switches its raycaster off in its
  drawing mode (`.__none__`) — dragging pauses then, rotate/pinch don't.
