# Spawn Sequence feature guide

Models spring up one after another — at an interval or on a timeline, in
front of the viewer or at random spots — each growing from nothing with an
elastic bounce, optionally with its own one-shot positional sound.
Applicable to any (empty) entity. Merged from two Augmented Bahnhofsviertel
ports (`augmented-bahnhofsviertel`: #4 Europaplatz II's
`distance-place-interval`, #6 Birdkin(d)'s `distance-place-sequence`) — see
[3. Under the hood](#3-under-the-hood).

Files:

```
src/a-frame-components/spawn-sequence.ts
examples/spawn-sequence-usage.html   # scene wiring + attribute reference
```

No shipped assets (the models and sounds are a project's content).
Related: [Random Field](RANDOM-FIELD-FEATURE-GUIDE.md) scatters copies all
at once; Spawn Sequence adds them over time.

## 1. Step-by-step: adding this to a new project

1. **Copy** `spawn-sequence.ts` into `src/a-frame-components/`.

2. **Nothing to register** — every component file in
   `src/a-frame-components/` is registered automatically under its file
   name as soon as the scene uses it (README, "The manifest"); unused ones
   aren't even bundled. Only a component registered under a different name,
   or one whose name is built at runtime, needs a manual entry in
   `src/manifest.ts`.

3. **Add the content** — the models (`.glb`) and optional sounds to
   `src/assets/`; list their ids in `models` / `sounds`.

4. **Wire the scene** — an empty entity with `spawn-sequence`, usually
   inside a [Placement](PLACEMENT-FEATURE-GUIDE.md) scene
   (`examples/spawn-sequence-usage.html`). With sounds: `auto: false`, and
   dispatch `spawn-sequence-start` from a tap (e.g. an [AR Overlay](AR-OVERLAY-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)
   "Start" control) — iOS needs the gesture.

5. **Build and test** — `npm run dev` already shows the spawning; the
   camera-relative positions and sound only make sense in `npm run dev:ar`
   on a phone.

## 2. Entities & attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `models` | array | `[]` | Model asset ids, cycled in `order`. |
| `order` | string | `sequential` | `sequential` or `random`. |
| `interval` | number | `1000` | ms between spawns (when `times` is empty). |
| `delay` | number | `0` | ms before the first spawn (interval mode). |
| `times` | array | `[]` | Seconds after start for each spawn; overrides `interval`/`count`. |
| `count` | int | `10` | Spawns in interval mode; `0` = endless. |
| `auto` | boolean | `true` | Start on init; `false` = on `spawn-sequence-start`. |
| `mode` | string | `camera` | `camera`: in front along the view direction; `random`: within `radius` of the origin. |
| `distance` / `variation` | number | `3` / `0.5` | camera mode: distance ± variation/2 (local units). |
| `radius` | number | `3` | random mode: radius. |
| `floor` | boolean | `true` | Models on y = 0; `false` = at the view ray's height (camera mode). |
| `facing` | string | `camera` | `camera`, `random` or `none`. |
| `scaleMin` / `scaleMax` | number | `1` / `1` | Random target scale range; equal = fixed. |
| `growDuration` | number | `750` | ms to spring up. |
| `easing` | string | `easeOutElastic` | Any A-Frame animation easing. |
| `castShadow` / `receiveShadow` | boolean | `true` / `false` | Shadow settings of each model. |
| `sounds` | array | `[]` | Audio asset ids, one per spawn (cycled). |
| `volume`, `refDistance`, `maxDistance`, `rolloffFactor`, `distanceModel` | — | `1`, `1`, `10000`, `1`, `inverse` | Positional sound settings; distances are multiplied by the entity's world scale. |

Events: **in** `spawn-sequence-start`, `spawn-sequence-stop`,
`spawn-sequence-clear` (removes all spawned models); **out**
`spawn-sequence-spawned` `{ el, index }`, `spawn-sequence-done`.

```html
<a-entity place-in-front="distance: 0">
  <a-entity spawn-sequence="models: #slat1, #slat2; interval: 1000; count: 40; distance: 4"></a-entity>
</a-entity>
```

## 3. Under the hood

**One component for two originals.** #4 placed a slat every second (fixed
scale, turned to the viewer, `runs` with an off-by-one), #6 placed
membranes on a timeline of seconds (random heading, random size, one sound
each). Both computed the same thing: the camera's position and view
direction converted into the entity's space, a point `distance ±
variation/2` along that direction, dropped to the floor, then a 750 ms
elastic scale-up. The differences are exactly the attributes above
(`interval`/`times`, `facing`, `scaleMin`/`scaleMax`, `sounds`), so one
component with those options replaces both; `mode: random` and
`order: random` are new.

**Clock.** Time is accumulated in `tick` (not `setInterval`), so `times`
can be fractional, the sequence pauses with the entity, and it waits while
an enclosing `place-in-front` scene hasn't been placed yet (the originals
waited for their scene placement). Several spawns that fall into one frame
are all made in that frame.

**Positions are local.** The camera pose is converted into the entity's
space with its inverse world transform, and models are children of the
entity — so the sequence works inside any scaled/rotated parent; the view
direction includes the pitch, so looking down spawns closer (as in the
originals).

**Bounce after load.** Each model starts at scale 0.001; the grow
animation (`animation__spawn-grow`) is set when its mesh arrives
(`object3dset`), so a slow-loading model doesn't spend its bounce while
still invisible.

**Sound distances.** `sound`'s refDistance/maxDistance are world units;
they're multiplied by the entity's world scale once the sound has loaded,
so a "fades within 4 units" sound stays proportional inside a scaled scene
(like [Placement](PLACEMENT-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)'s `scaleSounds`, which only
sees sounds present at placement time).

## 4. Incompatibilities, risks & troubleshooting

- **Audio before a gesture.** On iOS a spawned model's sound stays silent
  unless audio was unlocked by a tap first — start the sequence inside a
  tap handler.
- **Many models.** Every spawn is a new glTF entity (the asset itself is
  loaded once and shared). Endless sequences (`count: 0`) keep adding;
  use `spawn-sequence-clear` or a finite count for long sessions.
- **Shared materials.** Spawned copies share the asset's materials — a
  component that mutates materials must clone them (all template
  components do).
- **Animations.** Spawned models don't get `animation-mixer`; for animated
  models listen to `spawn-sequence-spawned` and set it on `detail.el`.
  Frustum culling: put `no-frustum-cull` on the module root as usual.
- **Combining.** Spawned models are plain children; gestures or other
  components can be added in a `spawn-sequence-spawned` listener. The
  spawner itself writes nothing to its own transform, so it may sit on a
  placed or attached entity.
