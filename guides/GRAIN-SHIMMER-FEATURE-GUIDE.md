# Grain Shimmer feature guide

A grainy surface that sparkles as the viewer or the model moves — the look
of #20 Solid Dream Level (`augmented-bahnhofsviertel`), available for any
model: textures sampled without mipmaps, plus optional grain added in the
shader (fixed to the surface, or trickling like film grain). Applicable to
any entity with a mesh. An original feature built from an analysis of that
work — see [3. Under the hood](#3-under-the-hood).

No assets.

## 1. Step-by-step: adding this to a new project

1. **Copy** `grain-shimmer.ts` into `src/a-frame-components/`.

2. **Nothing to register** — every component file in
   `src/a-frame-components/` is registered automatically under its file
   name as soon as the scene uses it (README, "The manifest"); unused ones
   aren't even bundled. Only a component registered under a different name,
   or one whose name is built at runtime, needs a manual entry in
   `src/manifest.ts`.

3. **Wire the scene** — `grain-shimmer` on the model
   (`examples/grain-shimmer-usage.html`). Grainy textures: `grain: 0`
   (filter only). Smooth textures: the default adds shader grain.

4. **Build and test on a phone** (`npm run dev:ar`) — the effect is the
   movement; a still image only shows the grain.

## 2. Entities & attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `filter` | string | `linear` | `linear` or `nearest`: the model's textures without mipmaps (`nearest` = harder, pixelated); `mipmap`: textures unchanged. |
| `grain` | number | `0.35` | Shader grain strength 0–1 (brightness noise); `0` = no shader change. |
| `grainScale` | number | `300` | Grain cells per local unit, in object space. |
| `animated` | boolean | `false` | Re-seed the grain over time — it trickles even when nothing moves. |
| `speed` | number | `24` | Re-seeds per second when `animated`. |

No events.

## 3. Under the hood

**Where #20's shimmer comes from.** Its textures are pixel-fine spray-paint
grain (2000 px), and its glTF sampler says `minFilter: LINEAR` — no
mipmaps. When a texture is drawn smaller than it is, each screen pixel then
samples one grain at random instead of an average, and with every small
movement a different one: the surface sparkles. With mipmaps the grain
would blur into a calm mixed colour. (All the old Cinema 4D exports of the
Augmented Bahnhofsviertel works carry that sampler; only #20's texture
content makes it visible.)

**`filter`.** Each texture slot (map, emissive, roughness, metalness, AO,
normal, alpha) is cloned — the clone shares the image but has its own
sampler settings — and set to `minFilter` Linear/Nearest with
`generateMipmaps = false`. Without cloning, every other copy of the asset
(or another material using the texture) would change too.

**`grain`.** A shader patch (`onBeforeCompile`) passes the object-space
vertex position to the fragment shader and multiplies the diffuse colour
after `map_fragment` by `1 + (hash(floor(pos · grainScale)) − 0.5) · 2 ·
grain`. Object space makes the grain stick to the model (it sparkles with
movement exactly like texture grain); `animated` changes a seed uniform
`speed` times a second. Strength, scale and seed are uniforms, so changing
them never recompiles; the program cache key is extended with
`|grain-shimmer`.

**Materials are cloned** and the originals restored on `remove()`. The
patch chains an `onBeforeCompile` already on the original material (and its
cache key) — `material.clone()` doesn't copy those, so they're taken over
explicitly. A-Frame primitives load their `material` texture asynchronously
onto A-Frame's own material object; the component re-applies on
`materialtextureloaded`.

## 4. Incompatibilities, risks & troubleshooting

- **Other shader patches.** Dither Material, Proximity Fade/Cutout and
  other `onBeforeCompile` users: this component chains a patch that exists
  on the material *before* it runs. A component that patches *after* it and
  replaces `onBeforeCompile` drops the grain. Set grain-shimmer last, and
  see [cross-feature-reference-docs/RENDER-ORDER-AND-TRANSPARENCY-GUIDE.md](../cross-feature-reference-docs/RENDER-ORDER-AND-TRANSPARENCY-GUIDE.md)
  on program cache keys.
- **Material swappers.** [Material Properties](MATERIAL-PROPERTIES-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)
  and [`unlit-material`](LOD-BILLBOARD-FEATURE-GUIDE.md) replace materials;
  applied after grain-shimmer they remove it. Add grain-shimmer last.
- **Changing an A-Frame primitive's `material` attribute** later updates
  A-Frame's own material, not the cloned one — remove and re-add
  grain-shimmer after such a change.
- **Aliasing is the point.** Without mipmaps distant textures also flicker
  strongly; on big, far-away surfaces that can look noisy rather than
  sparkly — use `filter: mipmap` with shader grain there.
- **Performance.** The shader patch adds a few instructions per pixel; no
  extra textures or render passes.
