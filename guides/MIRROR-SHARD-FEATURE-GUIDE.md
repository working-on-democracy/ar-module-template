# Mirror-shard feature guide

<!-- overview -->
## Overview

A wall of glass splinters hanging in the air, like a shattered mirror
frozen just before it falls. The pieces sway gently on their own; tap the
wall and a ripple runs outward from that spot through all the shards, as
if a stone had dropped into water made of glass. Behind the glass, an
optional living ink picture (see Liquid Texture) shimmers through and
stirs with every tap. The glass catches light at its edges like real
glass does.

## Technical summary

A field of 112 glass "mirror shards" that ripple outward from tapped points
with a gentle idle sway, rendered in three merged draw calls total
regardless of shard count. It consists of a tuned impact/idle motion
shader, bundled shard geometry and a glass rim-light effect; positioning
is left to ordinary A-Frame transforms. See
[3. Under the hood](#3-under-the-hood).

### Project context: origin

Salvaged and substantially reworked from `Zhichang_module`'s
`dms-mirror-shards` — an artistic installation piece authored on another AR
platform, redesigned with ChatGPT, then adapted into this project with
Claude. The port kept the motion shader and the shard geometry, merged what
the source left as 112 separate draw calls, and dropped the source's own
SLAM-based AR placement system, multi-panel layout, and shatter-and-fall
"fracture" mode (details in §3) — placement in particular duplicated what
the template already gets from 8th Wall + A-Frame natively.

This is the worked example (alongside `LIQUID-TEXTURE-FEATURE-GUIDE.md`) for
`ADDING-FEATURES-WORKFLOW.md`'s process extended with *salvaging*: keeping
one specific visual effect out of a much larger, tangled prototype whose
overall approach (custom AR placement) isn't wanted at all.

Files:

```
src/a-frame-components/
  mirror-shard.ts             # the shard field
  mirror-shard-data/shards.json  # bundled shard geometry (112 triangles)
(registered automatically by file name — nothing to add to src/manifest.ts)
examples/mirror-shard-usage.html # scene wiring + full attribute reference
examples/mirror-shard-liquid-texture-scene.html # both components combined
```

`mirror-shard`'s optional inner illustration layer is powered by a
**separate, generic** component, `liquid-texture` — its own guide is
`LIQUID-TEXTURE-FEATURE-GUIDE.md`. `mirror-shard` only *consumes* it (via a
selector attribute); it has no idea how that texture is produced.

## 1. Step-by-step: adding this to a new project

1. **Copy the component and its data** — `mirror-shard.ts` and the
   `mirror-shard-data/` folder (containing `shards.json`) into your
   project's own `src/a-frame-components/`. No path changes — `shards.json`
   is imported via a relative path from `mirror-shard.ts` itself, so the
   two travel together as a unit.

2. **Copy `liquid-texture.ts` too** if you want the inner illustration
   layer (recommended — see its own guide for why it's worth having even
   without a custom target image). Purely optional: `mirror-shard` works
   without it, falling back to a flat tint.

3. **Nothing to register** — every component file in
   `src/a-frame-components/` is registered automatically under its file
   name as soon as the scene uses it (README, "The manifest"); unused ones
   aren't even bundled. Only a component registered under a different name,
   or one whose name is built at runtime, needs a manual entry in
   `src/manifest.ts`.

4. **Wire it into the scene** — see [2. Entities & attributes](#2-entities--attributes)
   or copy directly from `examples/mirror-shard-usage.html` (attribute-by-
   attribute reference) or `examples/mirror-shard-liquid-texture-scene.html`
   (both components combined into one scene). Remember
   `class="cantap"` on the entity if you want the built-in tap-to-pulse —
   see [4](#4-incompatibilities-risks--troubleshooting) for why the
   component can't set that for itself.

5. **Build and test** — `npm run build`, then `npm run dev` for a
   VR/desktop preview (tap-to-pulse works via mouse click in the desktop
   preview too, since it goes through the same A-Frame cursor system).

## 2. Entities & attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `height` | number | `1.86` | Overall physical height (metres) the shard field is scaled to. No separate width — it follows the bundled layout's own aspect ratio. |
| `motionEnabled` | boolean | `true` | `false` freezes the field in its rest pose. |
| `idleRotationEnabled` | boolean | `true` | The gentle idle sway. |
| `idleRotationStrength` | number | `1` | Scales the idle sway's amplitude (~0-2). |
| `shockAfterglow` | number | `1` | Scales the lingering glow/ripple after a pulse's initial impact (~0-2). |
| `liquidTarget` | selector | — | Entity carrying `liquid-texture`; its rendered texture becomes the inner illustration layer. Omit for a flat tint. |

Position/rotate/scale the entity itself like any other A-Frame entity —
there's no separate placement attribute or system.

```html
<a-entity class="cantap" position="0 1 -3" mirror-shard="height: 1.86; liquidTarget: #shard-liquid"></a-entity>
```

Method: `pulse(x?, y?, strength?)` — triggers an impact ripple at local
`(x, y)` (both default `0`, the field's centre); `strength` defaults to a
small random value (~1.16-1.46) if omitted, matching a plain tap. Also
pulses `liquidTarget` if set, so the two stay visually coupled. Call this
from any other component (e.g. an `ar-button`'s tap handler) for tap
sources other than the built-in `click` listener.

Event: `mirror-shard-pulse` (non-bubbling, detail `{x, y, strength}`) —
emitted on every pulse, from any source, for anything else that wants to
react.

## 3. Under the hood

### What the component consists of

- **An impact/idle displacement shader** (`shardApplyMotion`) — the tuned
  math that makes the shards ripple outward from a tap and sway gently at
  idle.
- **The shard geometry** — a bundled 112-triangle layout (`shards.json`).
- **A glass-optics fresnel rim light** — a small fragment-shader injection
  that makes the glass material read as glass at grazing angles; plain
  "how do you make three.js physical glass look right".

#### Project context: `Zhichang_module`

##### What was kept, what was dropped, and why

The source file (`dms-mirror-shards.ts`, 4,716 lines) bundled together: the
shard visual effect itself, a separate "liquid ink" marbling effect, a
custom SLAM-based AR placement system (duplicating what this template
already gets from 8th Wall + A-Frame — explicitly not wanted), a
multi-panel layout system, a shatter-and-fall "fracture" mode, and DOM
chrome/status-text/debug tooling for the standalone prototype. Kept:

- **The impact/idle displacement shader** (`dmsApplyMotion` in the source,
  `shardApplyMotion` here) — the tuned math that makes the shards ripple
  outward from a tap and sway gently at idle. Ported near-verbatim. One
  piece was removed: a term that biased shards to physically gather toward
  one of two hardcoded "political choice" directions (`shapePolarity`/
  `shapeFinal`, feeding `blueGather`/`orangeField` in the source), coupled
  to the source's dual-target liquid effect. That mechanic only makes
  sense paired with the two-target "choice" narrative this port
  deliberately dropped (see `LIQUID-TEXTURE-FEATURE-GUIDE.md`); the
  impact-ripple and idle-breathing systems it was layered onto are
  untouched.
- **The shard geometry** — the bundled 112-triangle layout (`shards.json`).
  The source had two files, `shards-data.json`/`shards-impact-star.json`;
  they were byte-for-byte identical, so only one is kept.
- **The glass-optics fresnel rim light** (`attachGlassOpticsToMaterial` in
  the source) — a small fragment-shader injection that makes the glass
  material read as glass at grazing angles. Kept verbatim; it's not
  narrative-specific, just "how do you make three.js physical glass look
  right."

Dropped entirely: the SLAM placement system (`dms-world-room-anchor` and
the duplicate placement schema/handlers inside the shard component itself
— the latter were already dead in the source branch's own real usage,
which set `placeFromCameraOnStart: false; manualPlacementOnStart: false`);
the multi-panel layout (`panelLimit`/panel spacing — the source's own real
usage always used exactly 1 panel); the shatter-and-fall fracture mode
(`enableFracture` and its stress/break/fall/hold/recover state machine —
also `false` in the source's real usage, and a materially different visual
effect from "ripples and sways" in its own right, not attempted here); all
DOM chrome, status text, and debug/diagnostic tooling
(`updateDebugState`/`arStatus`/the performance HUD/the query-string quality
override); the auto-cycle attribute (dead in the source — declared but
never read anywhere). `examples/mirror-shard-liquid-texture-scene.html`
recreates the original installation scene as closely as the template
allows, with every attribute mapped back to its values.

### Merging the glass layer into one draw call

One `Mesh` + one `MeshPhysicalMaterial` per shard would be expensive:
`MeshPhysicalMaterial` with `transmission`/`clearcoat` is one of three.js's
costlier material types, and each copy would need its own shader compile.
The component therefore builds all 112 shard shapes, bakes each shard's
tint (`colorForShard(seed)`) into a **vertex color** instead of a separate
material instance, and merges all 112 into **one** `BufferGeometry` +
**one** shared `MeshPhysicalMaterial({ vertexColors: true, ... })`. The
glass-optics and motion shader patches (`onBeforeCompile`) run once. The
inner illustration and edge/highlight layers are merged the same way.

Opacity and roughness are shared by all shards — unlike colour, three.js
can't vary them per-vertex without more custom shader work. The per-shard
colour tint is what actually reads as "each shard is a little different."

<!-- project-specific -->
#### Project context: `Zhichang_module`

The source built one `Mesh` + one `.clone()`d `MeshPhysicalMaterial` per
shard (112 of each) even in its default, non-fracture configuration — the
single most expensive part of the original. Its inner illustration and
edge/highlight layers were already merged in non-fracture mode
(`mergeStaticLayers`). One deliberate loss from merging: the source gave
each shard a small jitter in *opacity* (`0.20 + noise*0.045`) and
*roughness* (`0.032 + noise*0.032`); the port uses the midpoint of each
range instead. The visual difference is subtle.

<!-- /project-specific -->

### Motion attribute plumbing

Each shard's geometry carries two custom vertex attributes,
`shardCenter`/`shardSeed` (purely internal shader plumbing, never exposed in
the component's schema/API). These survive the merge
into one `BufferGeometry` unchanged (each shard's vertices keep their own
`shardCenter`/`shardSeed` values), which is *why* the merge doesn't break
per-shard motion — the displacement shader reads these per-vertex, not from
anything material- or mesh-instance-specific.

### Tap handling

Listens for the plain `click` event A-Frame's cursor/raycaster system
synthesizes for `.cantap`-classed elements (the same mechanism
[Image Tracking](IMAGE-TRACKING-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)'s `xrextras-play-video`
uses) — **not** the `ar-button`/`ar-button-manager` system
(`pointerdown`/`pointerup`). This is deliberate: it is the host's standard
tap mechanism, and it adds no *second* raycast/tap system that could
interfere. See [4](#4-incompatibilities-risks--troubleshooting) for a
caveat on `click` specifically, the same one documented for Image Tracking.

<!-- project-specific -->
#### Project context: `Zhichang_module`

The source's `dms-installation` entity already used `class="cantap"` and
`click` in its `ArModule.vue`, so there was nothing to fix here. The motion
attributes were renamed from the source's `dmsCenter`/`dmsSeed`.

<!-- /project-specific -->

## 4. Incompatibilities, risks & troubleshooting

### `class="cantap"` is required, and the component can't set it

Unlike `ar-button` (which does its own raycasting and needs no class),
`mirror-shard`'s tap-to-pulse relies entirely on the host's shared camera
cursor/raycaster, which — per `main`'s own manifest-typing comments — is
scoped to elements classed `.cantap`. `mirror-shard.ts` doesn't add that
class itself (a component adding a class to its own host element on `init`
is fragile against a project's own class list on that element), so remember
it in markup. Forgetting it doesn't error — the field just never receives
a `click` and never pulses on its own (you can still drive it via
`pulse()` from other code).

### The same `click`-suppression risk already documented for [Image Tracking](IMAGE-TRACKING-FEATURE-GUIDE.md)

`SOUND-FEATURE-GUIDE.md` documents that iOS Safari has been observed to
suppress the synthetic `click` A-Frame's cursor system produces, once
anything upstream in that touch sequence (e.g. `xrextras-gesture-detector`,
used for pinch/rotate) called `preventDefault()` — which is exactly why the
sound feature's own tap system uses raw `pointerdown`/`pointerup` instead.
`mirror-shard` (like Image Tracking's `xrextras-play-video`) uses `click`, so it's
subject to the same risk: if a project combines pinch/rotate gestures with
a tappable mirror-shard field, tapping it may fail specifically on iPad/
iPhone. Not verified directly here either — same recommendation as the
sound guide: test on an actual device before shipping if you combine the
two.

### No interaction found with `proximity-fade`/`proximity-cutout`

Checked directly: those two features only ever touch materials reached via
a bubbled `model-loaded` event from a `gltf-model` descendant.
`mirror-shard`'s glass/inner/edge/highlight meshes are built directly from
`THREE.ShapeGeometry` — no `gltf-model` component is involved anywhere in
its construction, so `model-loaded` never fires for them and they're never
touched by either proximity feature, regardless of scene nesting.

### No interaction found with `ar-button`/`sound-button`

Different tap mechanism entirely (see above — `click` vs. `pointerdown`/
`pointerup`), different property writes (`mirror-shard` never touches
`object3D.scale`, which is `ar-button`'s own domain). The two can coexist
in the same scene freely. If a project wants an `ar-button` (with its
generic bounding-box trigger zone) to also drive a mirror-shard pulse
instead of relying on `.cantap`/`click`, call `pulse()` directly from an
`ar-button-tap` listener on a co-located or nearby entity — see
`examples/mirror-shard-usage.html`'s method reference.

### Performance: few draw calls, but an expensive material

Three merged draw calls (instead of 112+) is the headline win, but the
glass material is still a `MeshPhysicalMaterial` with `transmission`/
`clearcoat` — an inherently more expensive material type than a basic/
standard material, run across the whole merged mesh every frame regardless
of shard count. This is expected and matches how glass is meant to look;
if a project needs to go further, the next lever would be dropping
`transmission` for a cheaper fake-glass approximation (fresnel + alpha
blend only) — not attempted here since it would change the look, not just
the cost.

### Bundle size

`mirror-shard-data/shards.json` is ~62KB, bundled directly into
`ar-module.js` via a static import (not a `src/assets/` file — it's
geometry data the component needs synchronously at build time, not a
runtime-loaded asset). Expect `ar-module.js` to grow by roughly that much
plus the component code itself once this feature is included.
