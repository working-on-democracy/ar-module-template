# Headless AR testing (fake camera + emulated phone)

<!-- overview -->
## Introduction

AR scenes are normally tested by walking around with a phone in hand. That
isn't always possible — for instance when an AI assistant, which has no
phone and no hands, is supposed to check whether a scene works. This guide
describes a stand-in: a computer pretends to be an iPhone, and instead of a
real camera it is shown a short, generated video in which the scene's
target picture drifts gently back and forth, as if a hand were holding the
phone. The AR engine sees that "camera image", recognises the picture and
places the scene on it, and a screenshot plus the error log show whether
everything appeared as it should.

It's a quick health check, not a replacement for the real thing: walking
around, real phone speed and how a scene feels in the hand can only be
judged on an actual device.

## About this guide

How to check a scene in a real 8th Wall AR session (`dev:ar`) without a
phone: headless Chromium via Playwright, an emulated iPhone, and a
generated video of the image target fed in as the camera. Mainly meant
for AI agents, which can't hold a phone but can read screenshots and
console output. Not tied to one feature, so it lives here rather than in
a feature guide.

### Project context: `animationssystem-wanderer`

Verified 29.09.2026 on `animationssystem-wanderer`: the `an-alle-target`
image target was detected, the scene anchored on it and rendered
(wanderers, rings, tutorial overlay), console free of real errors. That
branch is a good test candidate (target in `src/image-targets/`).

<!-- /project-specific -->

## What this can and cannot verify

Can: the image target is detected and the scene anchors on it; the scene
renders (models, materials, overlays, tutorial/UI text, layout at phone
viewport size); console errors and uncaught exceptions; basic tap
interactions.

Cannot: SLAM/world tracking driven by real device motion (no IMU, the
"camera" is a flat video), real-device performance (WebGL runs on
SwiftShader, a software renderer, so frame rate and GPU-specific bugs say
nothing), WebXR `immersive-ar` sessions, how interaction actually feels.
Those still need a test on a real phone (`npm run dev:ar`, open the LAN
URL, see README.md).

## Branch

`feature_template` has no scene content of its own, so it shows the
camera feed and nothing else. Test on a branch with an actual scene.
With an image target in `src/image-targets/`, the check also covers
detection and anchoring (the procedure below). Without one it can still
check rendering, layout and the console, but not placement in space
(no SLAM, see above) — that case has not been tried.

## Prerequisites (once per machine)

- `npm install` (Playwright is already a devDependency).
- `npx playwright install chromium`: browser build matching the repo's
  Playwright version.
- `ffmpeg` (e.g. `brew install ffmpeg`) to generate the camera video.

## 1. Generate the fake camera video

Chromium's fake capture device plays a `.y4m` file as the camera. A
static frame of the target was not what we verified; a slowly moving
target (like a hand-held phone drifting) is. Use the target's
`_luminance.png` from `src/image-targets/`, placed smaller than the frame
on a neutral background, portrait:

```sh
ffmpeg -loglevel error -y \
  -f lavfi -i color=c=0x707070:s=720x960:r=30:d=10 \
  -loop 1 -i src/image-targets/<target>_luminance.png \
  -filter_complex "[1:v]scale=520:-1[t];[0:v][t]overlay=x='100+30*sin(2*PI*t/5)':y='(H-h)/2+30*cos(2*PI*t/5)':shortest=1,format=yuv420p" \
  /tmp/target-moving.y4m
```

`.y4m` is uncompressed: 10 s at this size is ~300 MB. Keep it outside
the repo (never commit it) and delete it afterwards.

## 2. Start the AR dev server

```sh
npx vite --mode ar --port 5199
```

Same as `npm run dev:ar` minus `--open` (no browser window to pop up),
on a fixed port for the script below. Serves https with a self-signed
cert.

## 3. Run the check

Save outside the repo, e.g. `/tmp/ar-check.mjs`, adjust the two
absolute paths, run with `node /tmp/ar-check.mjs`:

```js
import { chromium, devices } from '/ABS/PATH/TO/ar-module-template/node_modules/playwright/index.mjs';

const VIDEO = '/tmp/target-moving.y4m';
const browser = await chromium.launch({
  args: [
    '--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream',
    '--use-fake-device-for-media-stream',
    `--use-file-for-fake-video-capture=${VIDEO}`,
    '--enable-unsafe-swiftshader',
    '--ignore-gpu-blocklist',
  ],
});
const ctx = await browser.newContext({
  ...devices['iPhone 15 Pro'],
  ignoreHTTPSErrors: true, // self-signed dev cert
  permissions: ['camera'],
});
const page = await ctx.newPage();
const logs = [];
page.on('console', m => logs.push(`${m.type()}: ${m.text()}`));
page.on('pageerror', e => logs.push(`PAGEERROR: ${e.message}`));

await page.goto('https://localhost:5199/ar.html');
await page.waitForTimeout(4000);
await page.mouse.click(196, 426);     // tap mid-screen: dismisses tap-to-start overlays (e.g. sound unlock)
await page.waitForTimeout(12000);     // engine start + target detection
await page.screenshot({ path: '/tmp/ar-check.png' });
console.log(logs.join('\n'));
await browser.close();
```

Then look at `/tmp/ar-check.png`: target detected means the scene sits
on the (tinted) target in the frame; only the raw camera image means it
was not detected (wrong branch, wrong target image, or wait longer).

The import uses an absolute path because a script outside the repo
can't resolve the repo's `node_modules` by package name (ES modules
ignore `NODE_PATH`).

## Expected console noise (not errors)

Seen on a working scene, safe to ignore: `GPU stall due to ReadPixels`
and `CONTEXT_LOST_WEBGL: loseContext` (SwiftShader/engine internals),
`THREE.WebGLRenderer: ... useLegacyLights has been deprecated`, Vue's
`compilerOptions ... runtime-only build` warning, `core:schema:warn
Default value 0 does not match type color`, `meshopt_decoder is using
experimental SIMD support`. Anything tagged `PAGEERROR` or `error:` is
worth a look.

## Cleanup

Stop the dev server, delete the `.y4m`, the script and the screenshot
(all outside the repo), and switch back to the branch you started on.
